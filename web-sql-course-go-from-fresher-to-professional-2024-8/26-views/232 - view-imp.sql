-- very very very important point

if we update the data in the view then the data will also update in the table

How?
View - store address of data of table

*****) view store addresses that means if we want to retrieve or insert or update or delete or
any action it will go to table space in the hard disk using these addresses, that's
why what ever we do on view will perform on table also
