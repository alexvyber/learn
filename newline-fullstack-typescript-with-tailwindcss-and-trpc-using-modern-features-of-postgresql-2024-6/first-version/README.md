# How to use the application

This application consists from the main following parts:  frontend, backend, DB and terminal based functionality. Where each part is functionally linked with another. The app is built upon following core technologies: TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Node.js, tRPC, React, Koa, Knex and Tailwind CSS. Let's learn how to launch and interact with such application.

Here's how we interact with the application inside of the IDE:
- Wait for the automatic package installations to complete and for the `Run` button to become clickable. Packages are essential for the application functionality;
- Once the app is ready to be launched – you can start each of its parts with scripts/instructions via the `Terminal` tab. Or hit the `Run` button if all parts of your app include predefined scripts to run;
- If your app has any visual previews, they would be available in the `Browser` tab. And your logs in the `Console` tab;
- Also, in the `Browser` tab you can see the generated URL, so you can open and preview your app "live" right in your browser; 
- Feel free to play with the code the way you want. All your changes would be saved automatically. Also, if you ever get stuck and would want to reset your app to the original form – just hit the `Reset` button (at the top-right corner of the code window);
- That's it!
