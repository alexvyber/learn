Mastering TypeScript-Fourth Edition, Published by Packt

## About the book

TypeScript is both a language and a set of tools to generate JavaScript. It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft to help developers write enterprise-scale JavaScript.

Using a fast-paced, but easy-to-follow set of code samples, this fourth edition will get you up and running with Typescript quickly, introduce core concepts, and then build on this knowledge to help you understand and then apply more advanced language features.

Mastering TypeScript, Fourth Edition also covers a variety of modern JavaScript and TypeScript frameworks and compares their respective strengths and weaknesses. As you advance through this TypeScript book, you'll explore Angular, React, Vue, RxJs, Express, NodeJS, and others. You'll get up to speed with unit and integration testing, data transformation, serverless technologies, and asynchronous programming. Youâ€™ll also learn how to integrate with existing JavaScript libraries, control your compiler options, and use decorators and generics.

By the end of the book, you will have built a comprehensive set of web applications using Angular, React, and Vue, having integrated them into a single cohesive website, using micro front-end techniques. Mastering TypeScript, Fourth Edition is about learning the language, understanding when to apply its features, and then selecting the framework that is the perfect fit for your real-world project.
